# crypto-secured-chat

I created this Secure Chat service long time ago in 2009 during my Java study phase and I was impressed by the public key cryptography at that time.

It creates a custom encryption protocol. TLS protocol is not used. The custom protocol included the key exchange process using public key cryptography.

Of couse this custom protocol has alot of pitfalls from security prespective but it demonstrates how secret key can be shared using public key crypto.
